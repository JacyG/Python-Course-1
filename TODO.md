#A.1 Computer issues solution:

1. (Frank/Alex/Sebastian?) goes into the computer room in FaÃŸberg and checks that the following modules are installed:
    - python3
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib
    - ipython-notebook (check if input works)
    - networkx
    - pandas
    - .... feel free to add your requirements ....


2. We make sure all the packages in (1.) can be installed in:
    - Linux (?)
    - Mac (Alex)
    - Windows (Debsankha)


#A.2 Course contents changes:

1. Update the github repository with new contents. Debsankha created a ["release" zip](https://github.com/MPIDS/Python-Course/releases) of the current version. But the source document to many exercises and talks (.tex or .odf) are missing. 

2. Convert exerciuses into ipython notebook format. To be done by:
    - Introduction I (Alex)
    - Introduction II (Flo)
    - OOP (Norma)
    - numpy/scipy/matplotlib (Sebastian)
    - extra exercises (Whoever prepares the talk)

3. Check the talks for python3 compatibility : Debsankha

4. Introductory talk should have these additions:
    - How to start python in different ways. scripyts/ notebook/ whatever.
    - teach how to run python3 code in python2 without problem (special imports etc.)

5. Some ideas for extra modules to teach:
        - QT
        - networkx
        - Cython
        - profiling
        - debugging
        - packaging
        - git
        - virtual environments
        - pandas
        - image processing


6. Try to make more interesting exercises: everybody.



#A.3 Tasks to be done before the course begins:

1. send email to participants to know what extra topics they want. >2 weeks before.
2. have a meeting with participants to solve computer problems. ~1 week before.
