#A.1 Computer issues solution:

1. (Frank/Alex/Sebastian?) goes into the computer room in FaÃŸberg and checks that the following modules are installed:
    a. python3
    b. numpy
    c. scipy
    d. matplotlib
    e. ipython-notebook (check if input works)
    f. networkx
    g. pandas
    .... feel free to add your requirements ....


2. We make sure all the packages in (1.) can be installed in:
    a. Linux (?)
    b. Mac (Alex)
    c. Windows (Debsankha)


#A.2 Course contents changes:

1. Update the github repository with new contents. Debsankha creates a "release" zip of the current version.

2. Convert exerciuses into ipython notebook format. To be done by:
    a. Introduction I (Alex)
    b. Introduction II (Flo)
    c. OOP (Norma)
    d. numpy/scipy/matplotlib (Sebastian)
    e. extra exercises (Whoever prepares the talk)

3. Check the talks for python3 compatibility : Debsankha

4. Introductory talk should have these additions:
    a. How to start python in different ways. scripyts/ notebook/ whatever.
    b. teach how to run python3 code in python2 without problem (special imports etc.)

5. Some ideas for extra modules to teach:
        a. QT
        b. networkx
        c. Cython
        d. profiling
        e. debugging
        f. packaging
        g. git
        h. virtual environments
        i. pandas
        j. image processing


6. Try to make more interesting exercises: everybody.



#A.3 Tasks to be done before the course begins:

1. send email to participants to know what extra topics they want. >2 weeks before.
2. have a meeting with participants to solve computer problems. ~1 week before.
