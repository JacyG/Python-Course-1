#Project ideas

##Data processing
* spike detection in electrophysiological data
* some visualizations with statistical databases (e.g. Eurostat), Benford law
* network analysis with the python module "wikipedia"


##Image processing
* object tracking with opencv (e.g. a flock of birds in a youtube video)
* blob detection (size distribution of moon craters, intensity distribution of galaxies in Hubble Ultra-Deep Field image)
* event detection (cars, heart-rate)
* video stabilization
* webcam game (e.g. gesture-controlled Pong)


##Sound processing
* audio data transmission
* statistical characterization of noise (crackling noise of fire, noise of breaking waves, noise of rain)
* time analysis of a dripping faucet
* beat variations in human vs artificial music
* advanced: sonar

##Text processing
* identify the author of a text
* text generating markov model
* frequency distribution of words (Zipf's law)
* DNA sequence analysis

##Simulations:
* Ising model
* random walk
* Hebbian Learning/Hopfield network
* Leaky integrate and fire model
* particles in a gravity field (three body problem)
* bird/fish swarm
* spatial game theory
* sandpile model
* Lorentz attractor
* Julia set
* voters model
* Lotka Volterra model
* logistic map / Feigenbaum diagram
* Forest-fire model
* Conway's Game of Life
